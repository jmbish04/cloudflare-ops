You are building a serverless developer operations control plane using Cloudflare Workers written in TypeScript. The system uses Cloudflare's SDKs including the Sandbox SDK, Durable Objects, Queues, and Agent SDK. Your goal is to expose APIs and workflows that allow developers and agents to manage, test, and deploy Cloudflare infrastructure in a secure and scalable way. You will build endpoints that expose HTTP APIs, WebSocket interfaces, and dynamic OpenAPI specifications at /openapi.json and /openapi.yaml. The system must support direct API execution, guardrailed API paths with agent confirmation, and fully autonomous natural language execution paths. Durable Objects represent long-lived stateful actors. Queues coordinate background jobs. The Sandbox SDK runs isolated build and test workflows inside Cloudflare containers. This entire control plane must be modular, easy to extend, and able to run completely as a Cloudflare Worker. Authenticate API access with a secret key passed in he
